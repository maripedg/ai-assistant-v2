Foundations and history of artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence began as an audacious idea: could machines reason, learn, and solve problems the way people do? Early pioneers combined logic, search, and symbolic rules to build programs that played games and proved theorems. Those systems were powerful but brittle, struggling outside narrow puzzles. Progress arrived in cycles. Winters cooled expectations, then new data, better math, and faster hardware reopened doors. Machine learning shifted the focus from hand‑crafted rules to algorithms that learn from examples. Probabilistic models captured uncertainty; neural networks gained depth; and representation learning reduced manual feature design. The modern wave was ignited by three converging forces: massive datasets from the web, GPU acceleration, and open research communities. Together, they enabled models that understand language, recognize images, and plan sequences of actions. Yet history shows that breakthroughs rest on long chains of ideas and failures. Milestones such as backpropagation, convolutional networks, transformers, and reinforcement learning from human feedback are not isolated miracles. They are refinements built on decades of iteration, debate, and careful evaluation. Today’s systems appear magical, but their core is a modest principle: optimize an objective over data. That principle continues to reshape science, industry, and the arts.
