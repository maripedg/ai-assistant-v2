Machine learning vs deep learning: similarities and differences

Machine learning is the broad discipline of building systems that improve at a task through experience. It includes supervised learning, unsupervised discovery, reinforcement learning, and many hybrids. Deep learning is a subfield that uses layered neural networks to learn rich representations directly from data. The relationship is similar to geometry within mathematics. Traditional ML often depends on manual feature engineering: experts transform raw input into compact signals for models like linear regressors, trees, or kernels. Deep learning attempts to learn those representations automatically, using depth, nonlinearity, and gradient‑based optimization. Both approaches can use regularization, cross‑validation, and careful evaluation. Deep methods excel when ample data and compute are available, especially for images, audio, and natural language. Classical methods shine with tabular data, limited samples, or strict interpretability needs. In practice, teams combine them: gradient‑boosted trees with embeddings; linear models with learned features; or neural networks that output features for downstream predictors. The key is fit‑for‑purpose design, rigorous measurement, and keeping the problem’s constraints front and center.
