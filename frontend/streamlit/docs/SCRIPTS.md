# Scripts

Overview

- Helper scripts can live under scripts/. The folder may be empty in some deployments; add scripts here to automate maintenance tasks.

Examples (suggested)

- users_init.py: initialize admin or batch-create users.
- feedback_export.py: transform feedback JSON to CSV or dashboards.

Conventions

- Place scripts in frontend/streamlit/scripts/ and prefer argparse for CLI UX.
- Document inputs/outputs in the script header.
